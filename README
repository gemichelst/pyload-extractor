pyLoad Extractor Scripts
Version 0.5 - build 290320016
coded by gemichelst (http://github.com/gemichelst/pylpad-extractor

This script collection activates automatic extraction of finished packages or finished files in pyLoad.

Single files in a package will be moved or moved+extracted by using tags in PackageName at the pyload webgui. 
(useful for single archive files in the same package like: artist-album1.zip artist-album2.zip etc)

If no tag is prrsent in the psckage name  the script will move and extract the whole package at once. 
(useful for multiple/splitted archives like: file.part1.rar file.part2.rar)

The script will extract rar, zip, gzip, 7z and tar archives if the needed binarys are installed on system.
