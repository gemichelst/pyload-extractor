pyLoad Extractor Scripts
Version 0.5 - build 290320016
coded by gemichelst (https://github.com/gemichelst/pyload-extractor)

This script collection activates automatic extraction of finished packages or finished files in pyLoad.

Single files in a package will be moved or moved+extracted by using tags in packagename at the pyload webgui. 
(useful for single archive files in the same package like: artist-album1.zip artist-album2.zip etc)

[tags]
MVfile_  = will move every file to specified folder when finished download
MVEXfile_ = will and extract file to speciefied folder when finished download
MVpkg_ = not yet implemented
MVEXpkg_ = no need to set this tag

If no tag is present in the package name  the script will move and extract the whole package at once when finished downloading all files in the package 
(useful for multiple/splitted archives like: file.part1.rar file.part2.rar)

The script will extract rar, zip, gzip, 7z and tar archives if the needed binarys are installed on system.
