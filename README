pyLoad Extractor Scripts
Version 0.5 - build 290320016
coded by gemichelst (http://github.com/gemichelst/pylpad-extractor

This script collection activates automatic extraction of finished packages or finished files in pyLoad.

Single files in a package will be moved or moved+extracted by using tags in PackageName at the pyload webgui. 
(useful for single archive files in the same package like: artist-album1.zip artist-album2.zip etc)

If no tag is present in the psckage name  the script will move and extract the whole package at once when finished downloading all files in the package 
(useful for multiple/splitted archives like: file.part1.rar file.part2.rar)

The script will extract rar, zip, gzip, 7z and tar archives if the needed binarys are installed on system.
